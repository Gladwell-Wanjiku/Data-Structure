# Data-Structure
This document includes information on stacks and tuples. It shows how to create stacks and tuples, add and remove items from them.
 ## Stacks
 Stack is a data structure that follows the first in last out protocal. The strategy states that the element that is inserted first will be come out last. In order to make manipulations in stack, there are certain operation provides such as:
 push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull().
 ## Tuples
 A tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. To write a tuple containing a single value, you have to include a comma even if it is only one. Tuples are immutable which mean you cannot change the values.
 ## Queues
 A queue is a data structure that where elements are stored in a first in first out principle. The first element to be inserted is the first element to be accessed. A real world example of a queue is a line of cars in a one-lane one-way road where the first car exits first.
